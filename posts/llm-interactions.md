All humans are unique.
We look different,
have different voices,
different mannerisms,
different fashion preferences,
different ways of speaking,
and different personalities.
Part of what makes life fun,
is getting to know those other humans,
and building deeper connections with them.

LLMs are, in one sense, all the same.
There is only a handful of foundation models,
and even those are trained in such a way
that their default writing styles are very similar.

I work a remote job in tech.
This means that a large part of my interactions with other humans are online,
through text.
In text, the things that set us apart are stripped away.
You don’t hear voices or intonation,
you don’t see faces and body language.
We may get to pick a tiny picture as avatar,
but even the fonts are uniform.
The one thing that remains in text
— the last trace of personality that cannot be stripped away —
is writing style.

Recognizing somebodies writing style is part of getting to know that person.
