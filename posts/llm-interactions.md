All humans are unique.
We look different,
have different voices,
different mannerisms,
different fashion preferences,
different ways of speaking,
and different personalities.
Part of what makes life fun,
is getting to know those other humans,
and building deeper connections with them.

LLMs are, in one sense, all the same.
There is only a handful of foundation models,
and even those are trained in a way
that makes their default writing styles very similar.

I work a remote job in tech.
This means that a large part of my interactions with other humans are online,
through text.
In text, the things that set us apart are stripped away.
You don’t hear voices or intonation,
you don’t see faces and body language.
We may get to pick a tiny picture as avatar,
but even the fonts are uniform.
The one thing that remains in text
— the last trace of personality that cannot be stripped away —
is writing style.

Learning to recognizing somebodies writing style
is part of getting to know that person,
just like learning what their taste in food or music is.
With people I know well,
I can often identify the author by the writing style.
For natural language,
but even for code.
That we express ourselves in different ways,
is what makes interacting with other people fun!

So when humans start using <abbr>LLM</abbr>s to write text for them,
or rewrite text to sound more professional or eloquent,
that last trace of personality gets lost.
I can identify LLM use by the writing style as well,
and it makes me sad when real humans do that.
