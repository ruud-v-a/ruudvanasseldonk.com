Last weekend I participated in the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org).
In 48 hours, we made a game about a particle accelerator.
With our game, _The Small Bang Theory_, we won the first prize of
[our location](http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2012/ggjnl-nhtv-breda-university-applied-sciences),
and we have a chance of winning the national prize as well.

Due to a lack of artists, our team made a game which is all procedural.
The graphics are procedural, and there are infinitely many levels.
(Although you certainly deserve a honourable mention if you make it past level six ...)
The arcade-style game is available at
[the game jam site](http://globalgamejam.org/2012/small-bang-theory "The Small Bang Theory").
