During the past half year at [IGAD](http://made.nhtv.nl/),
I and my team have built the game _Geomancer_,
a chess-like game which is played by altering
the game world. The game will be presented at the Dutch game festival
[Indigo](http://dutchgamegarden.nl/indigo/editions/2012/geomancer/)
next week.

Indigo is an annual event organised by the
[Dutch Game Garden](http://dutchgamegarden.nl),
where game developers can showcase their games.
Our team has been allowed to showcase Geomancer here.

Geomancer -- the result of fourteen days of gamelab --
is a strategic game for two players. Characters can
modify the terrain by moving hexagons up or down.
This will damage hostile characters, while characters
will be more gentle to their own team. By building
staircases and walls, the opponent is forced to
think ahead, and choose his moves strategically.
