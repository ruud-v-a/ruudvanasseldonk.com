About six months ago, I was fed up with it.
The particular ‘it’ was Hashicorp Configuration Language,
but that was only the trigger,
by no means the only offender.

## I’ll write my own language

With list comprehensions. And types.

## Status

Something something, toy project, lose interest. But actually, already useful.
Not going away entirely.

## An unexpected jq alternative

## Why another configuration language?

There are already so many languages that claim to solve the
“write repetitive configuration in a nice way”-problem.
Why add another one to the pile?

To do: add list of alternatives.

## Conclusion

To do: write a conclusion.
