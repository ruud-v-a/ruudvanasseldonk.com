In recent years it has been revealed that tapping of internet traffic is happening at very large scales.
Automated eavesdropping of an astounding portion of all internet traffic is a fact of life.
Legislation will not stop agencies and other parties from hoarding your data.
It might make it illegal, but not impossible.
The only way to really stop agencies from listening in on you, is to make it impossible.
Use encryption, and encrypt _all_ of your internet traffic.
Encryption should be the default.

As of today, my site is available over a [secure connection][secure].
