After a long time in which I have had little time to work on Yaose,
I decided that it would be better to make Yaose free software.
This way, users do not have to wait for me.

Almost a year after previewing an alpha version, not much had changed.
This is a shame, because I think Yaose has great potential.
Therefore, the source code of Yaose is now
[freely available](http://veniogames.com/downloads/yaose/free-software).

The source code for Yaose is, however, slightly messy,
and not organised very well.
At first, I wanted to sort this out before releasing the source to the public.
I realised that this would take a lot of time,
and that it would take even longer to get a new version of Yaose out.
I could also spend that time on developing useful features.
Therefore, I decided to release the code at this point, maybe slightly messy.

Get it at Gitorious:

    $ git clone git://gitorious.org/yaose/yaose.git
